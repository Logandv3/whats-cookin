## Project Overview
In this project, we create a recipe tracking / meal planning application that allows users to view their favorite recipes and plan shopping trips around them.  Users should view a list of recipes, favorite their own recipes, and choose recipes to cook.

## Learning Goals
* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Make network requests to retrieve data


## How to Use

- A user will be displayed on page load.  All recipes will be displayed.  The user can search through the recipes in the search bar by name/ ingredient or select a tag, then submit.

- When a recipe is selected on the main page that same recipe will become larger and reveal information about the recipe including instructions.  On each individual recipe card the user will see options to add/ remove recipes from their favorites(star) list or list of recipes they want to cook(checkbox).

- The user can see the recipes they have added to their favorites or cooking list by clicking the `Favorite Recipes` and `What to Cook` buttons.  To return to the main page where all recipes are displayed they can click the `All Recipes` button.  The user can filter their favorite recipes by name/ ingredient or tags when looking at their favorite recipe list.
